# Parametric Drawer Divider

I needed boxes to divide up my Lista drawers ... a lot of them. As the original brand is quite expensive, I designed my own version. I used a parametric design approach and also improved the label holder for my purpose.

Parametric design allows me to create different versions of the box. You can adjust the height, width and length of the box to have the best fit for your use case / drawer. I've designed 2 versions of the box, split and simple - this was before I modified the design to be parametric, now I think it's quite obsolete, but maybe it still serves someone's needs.

My default segment size is 74mm and a height of 26mm as if perfectly fits my drawers. These and doubles of this segment size I provide as ready to go STL objects. But I also provide the fusion360 files (here in this repository) so you can change the dimensions yourself, export to stl and there you go... if you need help, let me know.
